is a Javascript/Python(2.5-2.7) tool for drawing and evaluating\nmathematical functions. It was designed for use with the edX online\ncourseware platform. However, it is a self-contained application that can be\nintegrated into other web platforms.\nDemo\nBefore we get into the technical details, try out a SketchResponse Demo to get a sense of what SketchResponse can do.\nMotivation\nTODO Martin said he would write a paragraph.\nFeatures\n\nSketch Tool - configurable Javascript front-end with plugin components to provide different\nfunction drawing and annotation capabilities. See\nSketch-Tool Plugin Configuration for a description of the available\nplugins.\nGrader Library - python back-end that provides an API of function grading methods that\ncan be composed to construct custom grading scripts. See\nCreate a Simple Grading Script for a tutorial on building\na simple grading script.\n\nRead More\n\nSketch Tool\nPreliminary results using SketchResponse on edX\n\n"},"getting_started.html":{"url":"getting_started.html","title":"Getting Started","body":"Getting started from zero\nPrerequisites\nTo work with the SketchResponse codebase, there are a few technology prerequisites that you will need installed on your machine.\n\nIn order to clone the repository you will need to install Git on your computer. You may also want to create a Github account, though you should not need one to simply clone the SketchResponse repository from the command line. You will need to be logged into a Github account if you want to clone the repository through your browser. You will also need a Github account if you want to contribute changes back to the project.\n\nThe Sketch Tool front-end is built using Node.js and npm (which is now packaged with Node). You will need to have both of these installed on your computer.\n\nThe Grader Library back-end is built using Python and relies on a couple python packages that you will need to install. We recommend you use the pip python package installer. If you are using an up-to-date python installation you probably already have it installed. If you already have another python package manager, we only use commonly available packages so it should not be a problem.\n\n\nNote for Windows Users: When installing Python make sure to enable the option to add Python to the path. This is disabled by default for some reason.\n\nYou will also need to be comfortable using the command-line to execute commands.\n\nNote for Windows Users: You should use the Git Bash shell to execute all commands in this document. You will need to run it as Administrator to execute the npm and pip installation commands below. You may also need to run the Git Bash shell as Administrator to run the local flask testing server. To do this, right-click Git Bash from the Start Menu and select Run as Administrator.\nIf you have statisfied all of the above prerequisites, then we can start working on the codebase.\nGetting the codebase\n\nClone this repository to the directory of your choice:\n\nBy using HTTPS:\n$ git clone https://github.com/SketchResponse/sketchresponse.git\n\n\nBy using SSH:\n$ git clone git@github.com:SketchResponse/sketchresponse.git\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning either of the above commands will create a new directory called SketchResponse. This SketchResponse directory is your copy of the repository. The rest of this document will refer to it as the repo directory.\n\nRun this command to change directories to the repo of the SketchResponse repository.\n$ cd sketchresponse\n\n\n\nBuilding the Sketch Tool front-end\n\nChange to the sketch_tool directory:\n$ cd sketch_tool\n\n\nInstall dependencies listed in package.json using npm. If you are in Windows make sure you are running the Git Bash shell as Administrator:\n$ npm install\n\nJSPM will pull in additional dependencies automatically on a post-install script.\n\nBuild a distribution of the Sketch Tool. The distribution directory will be found in the /static/sketch_tool_dist/ directory.\n$ npm run build\n\n\n\nNow you have a built distribution of the Sketch Tool front-end, we will use it later to let us test grading scripts. The front-end distribution is also what you will need to have hosted on a public server when deploying SketchResponse for your application.\nGrader Library back-end dependencies\nThe SketchResponse grader library back-end has only two third party package requirements, which are listed in the requirements.txt file.\n\nflask\nnumpy\n\nYou will need to be in the repo directory of the codebase. If you are still in the sketch_tool directory, run the following command to change back to the repo directory.\n$ cd ..\n\nNow that you are in the repo directory, you can run the following command to install the required python packages. If you are in Windows make sure you are running the Git Bash shell as Administrator\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nNumpy is used to support the mathematical computations of the grader library.\nFlask is required to run a local server for convenience when implementing and testing new grading scripts. This lets you test your scripts without having to deploy them to another server, giving you more immediate feedback and simplifying the debugging process. See the Tutorial Test a Grading Script on a Local Server for details.\nWhat&#39;s next\nNow that you have the codebase installed and ready to use, lets start looking at how to configure the Sketch Tool and implement a couple grading scripts. Click here.\n"},"using_sr.html":{"url":"using_sr.html","title":"Using SketchResponse","body":"Using SketchResponse\nUsing SketchResponse means writing python scripts to provide a configuration for the Sketch Tool front-end and an implementation of the grader method using the Grader Library back-end API. We call these grading scripts.\nWhat is a grading script\nBefore we get started writing scripts, we want to familiarize ourselves with the structure of a grading script. Read a description of the grading script template here\nWriting our first grading script\nNow that we know the pieces that must be implemented in the grading script, lets get started by implementing an extremely simple script. All this script will do is using the Grader Library to evalutate whether or not drawn function represents a straight line, or line segment. Click here to follow this tutorial.\nWriting a more complicated script\nOkay that was pretty easy, lets try building something a little more realistic. This grader script will be for a relatively simple polynomial function. Click here to follow this tutorial.\nTesting your grading scripts\nAs you probably saw at the end of each of our grading script examples, there was a brief description of testing that example script using a local server. More details on how to run that process can be found here.\nWhere to go from here\nAs you might expect, there are a lot of different types of function sketches that can be grading using this tool, however the current grading library is focused on introductory calculus type problems. We are working to expand the scope of the functions that can be sketched and graded, but it is a work in progress.\nWe have only demonstrated the use of a handful of the grading functions provided by the Grader Library Application Programming Interface(API). Explore the API to see what other grading options are available.\n"},"template.html":{"url":"template.html","title":"A grading script template","body":"Grading script template\nA grader script template can be see below. There are two components of the grader script:\n\nSketch Tool configuration\ngrader method implementation\n\nThe details of each of these components are examined in greater detail in the simple and complex(complex_grader.md) grading script examples.

All this grader will do is test whether the input function\nis of a straight line.\nEach grader script at its base is composed of two components\n 1. The problem configuration\n 2. The grader function\nImports\nThere are two SketchResponse python modules that must be imported for this simple example. All grader scripts must import the sketchresponse module. There are two other modules that provide different grading helper functions. In this case, we only need to input the GradeableFunction module from grader_lib.\nimport sketchresponse\nfrom grader_lib import GradeableFunction\n\nProblem configuration\nThe problem configuration is passed to the javascript front end to define the\nsize and scale of the drawing space and to define which drawing tools are\navailable for the problem. The sketchresponse.config() function takes a dict of\nconfiguration options.\nIn the example configuration below, the first seven key/value pairs are required:\n\n&#39;width&#39;: 750 sets the pixel width of the drawing space as 750 pixels\n&#39;height&#39;: 420 sets the pixel height of the drawing space to 420 pixels\n&#39;xrange&#39;: [-2.35, 2.35] sets the numerical range of the x axis\n&#39;yrange&#39;: [-1.15, 1.15] sets the numerical range of the y axis\n&#39;xscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39; sets the scale of the x axis to linear (only option currently implemented)\n&#39;yscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39; sets the scale of the y axis to linear (only option currently implemented)\n&#39;coordinates&#39;: &#39;cartesian&#39; or &#39;polar&#39; sets the coordinate system used by the axes plugin to either cartesian or polar\n\nThe last entry &#39;plugins&#39; takes a list of dicts that enable the specific javascript plugins that are available to the user. All plugins are declared by &#39;name&#39;.\nThe &#39;axes&#39; plugin entry is the simplest plugin to enable. It has no mandatory options so all that must be set is the &#39;name&#39;. This plugin enables the axes in the drawing space. It should probably be on by default no?\nThe &#39;freeform&#39; plugin entry enables the freeform drawing tool. It has three configuration options to set:\n\n&#39;id&#39; sets the name of the argument of the grader callback function (described in the next section) to which the data generated by this plugin is passed.\n&#39;label&#39; is the name of the tool displayed to the user.\n&#39;color&#39; is the color used to render the drawn function.\n\nA listing of all the built-in plugins can be found at SketchResponse Plugins.\nproblemconfig = sketchresponse.config({\n    &#39;width&#39;: 750,\n    &#39;height&#39;: 420,\n    &#39;xrange&#39;: [-2.35, 2.35],\n    &#39;yrange&#39;: [-1.15, 1.15],\n    &#39;xscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;yscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;plugins&#39;: [\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;axes&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;freeform&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;f&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Function f(x)&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;blue&#39;},\n    ]\n})\n\nThe above problem configuration settings will create a javascript tool that looks something like the image below.\n\nDefine the grader callback function\n\n\n@sketchresponse.grader\ndef grader(f):\n    gf = GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction(f)\n\n    if not gf.is_straight():\n        return False, &#39;Not straight&#39;\n\n    return True, &#39;Good Job&#39;\n\nThe grader callback function implements the function passed to the sketchinput\ngrader to evaluate the data sent from the javascript tool.\nThe arguments of the grader function are the &#39;id&#39; values as defined in the\nproblem configuration above. E.g. in our problem configuration we enabled the\nfreeform drawing tool with id &#39;f&#39; and we have a corresponding argument f in\nthe signature of the function that will be automatically unpacked.\nBefore we can execute any grading helper functions on the data, we must\ninstantiate the data as a GradeableFunction.\nIn this simple example all we are checking is that the submitted function\ndefines a straight line over its entire domain. We are not checking for slope\nof the line. To do this we call the grader helper function gf.is_straight().\nis_straight() returns a boolean value. The full API documentation for the\ngrader helper functions can be found at SketchResponse API.\nAnd that&#39;s it! Those two simple blocks of code complete our first grader script.\nAdmittedly this particular script doesn&#39;t do much. Check out the Complex Grader example for a more realistic grader tutorial on an\nexample math problem.\nTesting the script\nOnce the script is written, you can run the script in the local testing server. See the Test a Grading Script on a Local Server tutorial for details on installing and running the testing server.\nThere is already a copy of this grader script in the grader_scripts directory so all you need to do is start the server and point your browser of choice at the url:\nhttp://localhost:5000/simple_grader\nYou should see the configured Sketch Tool. If you draw a straight(ish) line and press the check button you will get accept message. If the line is not straight enough, you will get a reject message.\n"},"complex_grader.html":{"url":"complex_grader.html","title":"A complex grading script","body":"A more realistic grader script\nThis document will walk through the implementation of a grader script for\na more complicated problem than the Simple Grader Tutorial tutorial. The\nproblem description for this grader script is below.\nSketch the function f(x) = 2x2 / x2 - 1. \nLabel vertical and horizontal asymptotes, extrema, and inflection points.\n\nThis problem will introduce new javascript drawing plugins to handle labeling\nasymptotes and points and some new backend API functions that can be used to\nevaluate these new sources of data.\nImports\nThere are three SketchResponse python modules that must be imported for this simple example. As you saw in the Simple Grader Tutorial all grader scripts must import the sketchresponse module. We again need to input the GradeableFunction module from grader_lib, but also need to import the Asymptote module\nto support the asymptote labeling task.\nimport sketchresponse\nfrom grader_lib import GradeableFunction, Asymptote\n\nProblem configuration\nThe problem configuration is passed to the javascript front end to define the\nsize and scale of the drawing space and to define which drawing tools are\navailable for the problem. The sketchresponse.config() function takes a dict of\nconfiguration options.\nIn the example configuration below, the first seven key/value pairs are required. In this configuration we increase the ranges of the X and Y axes compared to the Simple Grader Tutorial:\n\n&#39;width&#39;: 750 sets the pixel width of the drawing space as 750 pixels\n&#39;height&#39;: 420 sets the pixel height of the drawing space to 420 pixels\n&#39;xrange&#39;: [-3.5, 3.5] sets the numerical range of the x axis\n&#39;yrange&#39;: [-4.5, 4.5] sets the numerical range of the y axis\n&#39;xscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39; sets the scale of the x axis to linear (only option currently implemented)\n&#39;yscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39; sets the scale of the y axis to linear (only option currently implemented)\n&#39;coordinates&#39;: &#39;cartesian&#39; or &#39;polar&#39; sets the coordinate system used by the axes plugin to either cartesian or polar\n\nThe last entry &#39;plugins&#39; takes a list of dicts that enable the specific javascript plugins that are available to the user. All plugins are declared by &#39;name&#39;.\nThe &#39;axes&#39; and &#39;freeform&#39; plugin usage here is identical to the Simple Grader Tutorial and is explained there as well as on the Plugin Description Page.\nThere are three new plugins introduced in this grading script: &#39;vertical-line&#39;, &#39;horizontal-line&#39;, and &#39;point&#39;. The declaration of these plugins is very similar to the declaration of the &#39;freeform&#39; plugin, however, each type of plugin has one additional parameter that needs to be defined: &#39;dashStyle&#39; for the lines, and &#39;size&#39; for the points.\nThe &#39;vertical-line&#39; plugin entry enables the a labeling tool for vertical asymptotes. It has four configuration options to set:\n\n&#39;id&#39; sets the name of the argument of the grader callback function (described in the next section) to which the data generated by this plugin is passed.\n&#39;label&#39; is the name of the tool displayed to the user.\n&#39;color&#39; is the color used to render the drawn function.\n&#39;dashStyle&#39; is the style of dashed line to used to draw the asymptote.\n\nThe &#39;horizontal-line&#39; plugin entry enables a labeling tool for horizontal asymptotes. Its configuration options mirror the &#39;vertical-line&#39;.\nIn this problem, we want students to label both extrema points and the inflection point for the function. To do this we can declare two instances of the &#39;point&#39; plugin with different &#39;id&#39; and &#39;label&#39; values. The &#39;point&#39; plugin has four configuration options to set:\n\n&#39;id&#39; sets the name of the argument of the grader callback function (described in the next section) to which the data generated by this plugin is passed.\n&#39;label&#39; is the name of the tool displayed to the user.\n&#39;color&#39; is the color used to render the drawn function.\n&#39;size&#39; is the pixel width of the point drawn by the plugin.\n\nA listing of all the built-in plugins can be found at SketchResponse Plugins.\nproblemconfig = sketchresponse.config({\n    &#39;width&#39;: 750,\n    &#39;height&#39;: 420,\n    &#39;xrange&#39;: [-3.5, 3.5],\n    &#39;yrange&#39;: [-4.5, 4.5],\n    &#39;xscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;yscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;plugins&#39;: [\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;axes&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;freeform&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;f&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Function f(x)&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;blue&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;vertical-line&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;va&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Vertical asymptote&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;gray&#39;, &#39;dashStyle&#39;: &#39;dashdotted&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;horizontal-line&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;ha&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Horizontal asymptote&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;gray&#39;, &#39;dashStyle&#39;: &#39;dashdotted&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;point&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;cp&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Extremum&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;black&#39;, &#39;size&#39;: 15},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;point&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;ip&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Inflection point&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;orange&#39;,&#39;size&#39;: 15}\n    ]\n})\n\nThe above problem configuration settings will create a javascript tool that looks something like the image below.\n\nDefine the grader callback function\n\n\nHandling the input data\n@sketchresponse.grader\ndef grader(f,cp,ip,va,ha):\n\n    f = GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction(f)\n    cp = GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction(cp)\n    va = Asymptote.VerticalAsymptotes(va)\n    ha = Asymptote.HorizontalAsymptotes(ha)\n    ip = GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction(ip)\n\n    msg=&#39;&#39;\n\nThe first thing that the grader function needs to do is format the input data so that Grader Library API methods of interest can be used to check specific features of the input data.\nAs explained in the Simple Grader Tutorial the data is passed to the grader function as a dictionary with keys equal to the &#39;id&#39; values used in the pluginconfig above so the dictionary can be directly unpacked into argument variables with the same names.\nThe &#39;freeform&#39; and &#39;point&#39; data are evaluated with API methods in the GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction class. The &#39;vertical-line&#39; and &#39;horizontal-line&#39; data are evaluted with API methods in the Asymptote.VerticalAsymptote and &#39;Asymptote.HorizontalAsymptote` classes respectively.\nThe msg variable will be used when evaluating specific checks on the data to supply check specific feedback to the student if errors are found.\nChecking the number of extrema points labeled\nif cp.get_number_of_points() != 1:\n   if cp.get_number_of_points() == 3:\n      msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Are you sure about the number of extrema? (note that you should not label the endpoints of your function)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n   else:\n    msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Are you sure about the number of extrema?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nThis first check verifies that there is only one extremum point labeled in the input data. It also checks for a common error case where students label the end points of their function to provide more helpful feedback.\nChecking the number of inflection points\nif ip.get_number_of_points() != 0:\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Are you sure about the number of extrema?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nThis particular function does not have any inflection points so this check verifies that the student did not put any unnecessary labels.\nChecking the number of asymptotes\nif va.get_number_of_asyms() != 2:\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Are you sure about the number of vertical asymptotes?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\n\nif ha.get_number_of_asyms() != 1:\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Are you sure about the number of horizontal asymptotes?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nThis function should have 2 vertical asymptote labels and 1 horizontal asymptote label. If either of theses checks fail, appropriate feedback messages are provided.\nChecking the position of the extremum point\nif not cp.has_point_at(x=0):\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Check the x value of your critical point&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nThe extremum point label for the function should be at position x=0.\nChecking the positions of the asymptotes\nif not va.has_asym_at_value(-1) or not va.has_asym_at_value(1):\n   v1 = va.closest_asym_to_value(-1)\n   v2 = va.closest_asym_to_value(1)\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Check the locations of your vertical asymptotes.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nif not ha.has_asym_at_value(2):\n   ha1 = ha.closest_asym_to_value(2)\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Check the locations of your horizontal asymptotes. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nThe vertical asymptotes should be at positions x=-1 and x=1. The horizonal asymptote should be at the position y=2. As you can see, you can also get references to the actual asymptote values if you wanted to use them for further checks, or to customize your feedback messages.\nChecking that the extremum point is on the freeform line\nmaxpt = cp.get_point_at(x=0)\n\nif not f.has_value_y_at_x(maxpt.y, maxpt.x):\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Make sure your critical points lie on your function!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nHere we get a reference to the extremum point and use that point&#39;s x and y coordinates to make sure that it is sitting on the freeform line of the function. The grader method does use a configurable threshold value to ensure pixel perfect placement is not necessary to pass this kind of check.\nChecking the increasing and decreasing ranges of the freeform line\nincreasing_ok = f.is_increasing_between(-4, -1) and f.is_increasing_between(-1, 0)\ndecreasing_ok = f.is_decreasing_between(0, 1) and f.is_decreasing_between(1, 4)\nif not (increasing_ok and decreasing_ok):\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Where should the graph be increasing and decreasing?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nThe freeform line drawn by the student should be increasing over the ranges (-4,-1) and (-1,0). It should also be decreasing over the ranges (0,1) and (1,4). Again these grading methods have configurable thresholds to ensure they don&#39;t unfairly fail student input.\nChecking the value of the freeform line over specific ranges\nif not f.is_greater_than_y_between(2,-4,-1):\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Your function seems to be in the wrong region on the interval (-4,-1)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nif not f.is_greater_than_y_between(2,1,4):\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Your function seems to be in the wrong region on the interval (1,4)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nif not f.is_less_than_y_between(0,-1,1):\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Your function seems to be in the wrong region on the interval (-1,1)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nHere we are performing three sanity checks on the values of the freeform line over specific ranges. First, we check that f(x) &gt;= 2 over the range (-4,-1). Second, we check that f(x) &gt;= 2 over the range (1,4). Lastly, we check that f(x) &lt;= 0 over the range (-1,1).\nChecking the curvature of the freeform line\ncurvature_up_ok = f.has_positive_curvature_between(-4, -1) and f.has_positive_curvature_between(1, 4)\ncurvature_down_ok= f.has_negative_curvature_between(-1,1)\n\nif not (curvature_up_ok and curvature_down_ok):\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Where is the function convave up and concave down?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nThe final checks we will perform make sure that the freeform line has the expected curvature over specific ranges. The curvature should be positive over the ranges (-4,-1) and (1,4). The curvature should be negative over the range (-1,1).\nPutting it all together\nCombining all the code above into a single function gives us the following. You will notice that the error message variable msg is tested at multiple points during the evaluation and used as an early failure condition. If the numbers of expected labels are not correct, then future checks are likely to not be able to run on the data so returning early ensures the student gets good feedback.\nimport sketchresponse\nfrom grader_lib import GradeableFunction, Asymptote\n\nproblemconfig = sketchresponse.config({\n    &#39;width&#39;: 750,\n    &#39;height&#39;: 420,\n    &#39;xrange&#39;: [-3.5, 3.5],\n    &#39;yrange&#39;: [-4.5, 4.5],\n    &#39;xscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;yscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;plugins&#39;: [\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;axes&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;freeform&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;f&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Function f(x)&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;blue&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;vertical-line&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;va&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Vertical asymptote&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;gray&#39;, &#39;dashStyle&#39;: &#39;dashdotted&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;horizontal-line&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;ha&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Horizontal asymptote&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;gray&#39;, &#39;dashStyle&#39;: &#39;dashdotted&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;point&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;cp&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Extremum&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;black&#39;, &#39;size&#39;: 15},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;point&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;ip&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Inflection point&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;orange&#39;,&#39;size&#39;: 15}\n    ]\n})\n\n@sketchresponse.grader\ndef grader(f,cp,ip,va,ha):\n\n    f = GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction(f)\n    cp = GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction(cp)\n    va = Asymptote.VerticalAsymptotes(va)\n    ha = Asymptote.HorizontalAsymptotes(ha)\n    ip = GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction(ip)\n\n    msg=&#39;&#39;\n\n    if cp.get_number_of_points() != 1:\n        if cp.get_number_of_points() == 3:\n            msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Are you sure about the number of extrema?

In this configuration we increase the ranges of the X and Y axes compared to the Simple Grader Tutorial:\n\n&#39;width&#39;: 750 sets the pixel width of the drawing space as 750 pixels\n&#39;height&#39;: 420 sets the pixel height of the drawing space to 420 pixels\n&#39;xrange&#39;: [-4, 4] sets the numerical range of the x axis\n&#39;yrange&#39;: [-2.5, 2.5] sets the numerical range of the y axis\n&#39;xscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39; sets the scale of the x axis to linear (only option currently implemented)\n&#39;yscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39; sets the scale of the y axis to linear (only option currently implemented)\n&#39;coordinates&#39;: &#39;cartesian&#39; or &#39;polar&#39; sets the coordinate system used by the axes plugin to either cartesian or polar. It defaults to &#39;cartesian&#39;.\n\nThe last entry &#39;plugins&#39; takes a list of dicts that enable the specific javascript plugins that are available to the user. All plugins are declared by &#39;name&#39;.\nThe &#39;axes&#39; and &#39;freeform&#39; plugin usage here is identical to the Simple Grader Tutorial and is explained there as well as on the Plugin Description Page.\nThere are three new plugins introduced in this grading script: &#39;polyline&#39;, &#39;line-segment&#39;, and &#39;stamp&#39;. The declaration of these plugins is very similar to the declaration of the &#39;freeform&#39; plugin, however, each type of plugin has additional parameters that need to be defined. This script also introduces the use of &#39;intialstate&#39; data to pre-populate the canvas with data to help define the problem.\nThe &#39;polyline&#39; plugin entry enables the a tool to draw either a multi-segment polyline, or a polygon depending on its configuration. In this problem we are using a polyline to intialize beam object and a polygon that the students will use to draw an isolation bubble. It has five or size configuration options to set here:\n\n&#39;id&#39; sets the name of the argument of the grader callback function (described in the next section) to which the data generated by this plugin is passed.\n&#39;label&#39; is the name of the tool displayed to the user.\n&#39;color&#39; is the color used to render the drawn line segments.\n&#39;closed&#39; if True draws renders a polygon, if False renders a polyline\n&#39;fillColor&#39; sets the fill color if &#39;closed&#39; is set to True\n&#39;readonly&#39; if True disables the plugin on the toolbar, but can still be used to draw initial state data.\n\nThe &#39;line-segment&#39; plugin entry enables a drawing tool for line segments. In this example we are using one line segment to initialize a mark on one of the beams, and another line segment that labels the forces in the intial state of the freebody diagram. Its configuration in this example uses six or seven configuration parameters.\n\n&#39;id&#39; sets the name of the argument of the grader callback function (described in the next section) to which the data generated by this plugin is passed.\n&#39;label&#39; is the name of the tool displayed to the user.\n&#39;color&#39; is the color used to render the drawn line segments.\n&#39;dashStyle&#39; is the style of dashed line to used to draw the asymptote.\n&#39;lengthConstraint&#39; sets the maximum length of the segment in pixels.\n&#39;readonly&#39; if True disables the plugin on the toolbar, but can still be used to draw initial state data.\n&#39;arrowHead&#39; optionally sets the length and width of an arrowhead on one end of the line segment.\n&#39;tag&#39; optionally enables a string label for each line segment drawn\n\nIn this problem, we want to label clockwise and counter-clockwise moments in the initial state of the freebody diagram. To do this we can declare two instances of the &#39;stamp&#39; plugin with different &#39;id&#39; and &#39;label&#39; values. The &#39;stamp&#39; plugin has five configuration options to set:\n\n&#39;id&#39; sets the name of the argument of the grader callback function (described in the next section) to which the data generated by this plugin is passed.\n&#39;label&#39; is the name of the tool displayed to the user.\n&#39;scale&#39; is a decimal value to scale the size of the source image.\n&#39;src&#39; is a path to the source image to use for the stamp.\n&#39;readonly&#39; if True disables the plugin on the toolbar, but can still be used to draw initial state data.\n\nThe final new feature introduced in this example is the &#39;initialstate&#39; configuration parameter. This parameter can be used to supply a set of data values to be drawn to the canvas automatically using any of the configured plugins. The data can be automatically generated using the local testing server.\nThis example uses the &#39;point&#39; plugin, but introduces the &#39;tag&#39; parameter, which can be optionally included with any plugin that draws to the canvas. It adds a string label to each point drawn.\nA listing of all the built-in plugins can be found at SketchResponse Plugins.\nproblemconfig = sketchresponse.config({\n    &#39;width&#39;: 750,\n    &#39;height&#39;: 420,\n    &#39;xrange&#39;: [-4, 4],\n    &#39;yrange&#39;: [-2.5, 2.5],\n    &#39;xscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;yscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;plugins&#39;: [\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;axes&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;polyline&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;pl&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Beam&#39;, &#39;closed&#39;: False, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;lightblue&#39;, &#39;readonly&#39;: True},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;polyline&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;pg&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Isolation bubble&#39;, &#39;closed&#39;: True, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;gray&#39;, &#39;fillColor&#39;: &#39;lightblue&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;point&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;pt&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Point&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;red&#39;, &#39;size&#39;: 5, &#39;hollow&#39;: False, &#39;readonly&#39;: True, &#39;tag&#39;: {&#39;value&#39;: &#39;tag&#39;, &#39;xoffset&#39;: 5, &#39;yoffset&#39;: -5, &#39;align&#39;: &#39;start&#39;}},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;line-segment&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;ls&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Force&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;green&#39;, &#39;dashStyle&#39;: &#39;solid&#39;, &#39;lengthContraint&#39;: 50, &#39;arrowHead&#39;: {&#39;length&#39;: 10, &#39;base&#39;: 7}, &#39;readonly&#39;: True},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;line-segment&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;c&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Segment&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;black&#39;, &#39;dashStyle&#39;: &#39;dashdotted&#39;, &#39;lengthContraint&#39;: 20, &#39;readonly&#39;: True, &#39;tag&#39;: {&#39;value&#39;: &#39;tag&#39;, &#39;xoffset&#39;: 5, &#39;yoffset&#39;: 5, &#39;align&#39;: &#39;start&#39;, &#39;position&#39;: &#39;middle&#39;}},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;stamp&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;cwm&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;CWM&#39;, &#39;scale&#39;: 0.5, &#39;src&#39;: &#39;/static/examples/cw_moment.png&#39;, &#39;readonly&#39;: True},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;stamp&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;ccwm&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;CCWM&#39;, &#39;scale&#39;: 0.5, &#39;src&#39;: &#39;/static/examples/ccw_moment.png&#39;, &#39;readonly&#39;: True}\n    ],\n    &#39;initialstate&#39;: {\n  &quot;pl&quot;: [\n    [\n      {\n        &quot;y&quot;: 41,\n        &quot;x&quot;: 93\n      },\n      {\n        &quot;y&quot;: 293,\n        &quot;x&quot;: 94\n      },\n      {\n        &quot;y&quot;: 293,\n        &quot;x&quot;: 563\n      }\n    ],\n    []\n  ],\n  &quot;pt&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 41,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 93,\n      &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;A&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 293,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 563,\n      &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;B&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  &quot;ls&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 344,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 468\n    },\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 296,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 468\n    }\n  ],\n  &quot;c&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 256,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 187,\n      &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;C&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 345,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 187\n    }\n  ],\n  &quot;cwm&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 126,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 93\n    }\n  ],\n  &quot;ccwm&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 293,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 280\n    }\n  ]\n}\n})\n\nThe above problem configuration settings will create a javascript tool that looks something like the image below.\n\nDefine the grader callback function\n\n\nHandling the input data\n@sketchresponse.grader\ndef grader(pl, pg, pt, ls, c, cwm, ccwm):\n\n    pl = PolyLine.PolyLines(pl)\n    pg = Polygon.Polygons(pg)\n    cls = LineSegment.LineSegments(c)\n\n    beam = pl.get_polyline_as_segments(0)\n\nThe first thing that the grader function needs to do is format the input data so that Grader Library API methods of interest can be used to check specific features of the input data.\nAs explained in the Simple Grader Tutorial the data is passed to the grader function as a dictionary with keys equal to the &#39;id&#39; values used in the pluginconfig above so the dictionary can be directly unpacked into argument variables with the same names.\nThe &#39;polyline&#39; data are evaluated with API methods in the PolyLine.PolyLines class, or the Polygon.Polygons class depending on if the plugin is configured &#39;closed&#39; or not. The &#39;line-segment&#39; data is evaluted with API methods in the LineSegment.LineSegments. The &#39;stamp&#39; data is not evaluated in this problem, but is evaluated exactly like &#39;point&#39; data using the GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction class.\nChecking the number of isolation bubbles drawn\n    if not pg.get_polygon_count() == 1:\n        return False, &quot;Did you forget the isolation bubble?&quot;\n\nThis first check verifies that there is only one isolation bubble drawn in the input data.\nChecking the intersections of the isolation bubble with the beams\n    poly = pg.polygons[0]\n\n    beam1 = beam.segments[0]\n    beam2 = beam.segments[1]\n\n    if len(pg.get_intersections_with_polygon_boundary(beam1, poly)) &gt; 0:\n        return False, &quot;Isolation bubble should not cut vertical beam.&quot;\n\n    if not len(pg.get_intersections_with_polygon_boundary(beam2, poly)) == 1:\n        return False, &quot;Isolation bubble should only cut the horizontal beam once.&quot;\n\nThere are two valid isolation bubbles that can be drawn for this problem. In both of them, the vertical beam should not be cut by the bubble and the horizontal beam should be cut at the point labeled C.\nChecking the beam points on the isolation bubble\n    if pg.point_is_on_boundary([-2, -1]) == None:\n        return False, &quot;Check where the isolation bubble cuts the horizontal beam.&quot;\n\n    if pg.point_is_on_boundary([-3, 2]) == None and pg.point_is_on_boundary([2, -1]) == None:\n        return False, &quot;Check the isolation bubble containment.&quot;\n\nThe correct isolation bubbles will have the point C on the horizontal beam on the boundary of the bubble. It will also have either the top endpoint of the vertical beam, A, or the right end point of the horizontal beam, B, on the bubble&#39;s boundary.\nAll checks passed, so return True\n    return True, &quot;Good job!&quot;\n\nPutting it all together\nCombining all the code above into a single function gives us the following. You will notice that the error conditions are tested at multiple points during the evaluation and used as an early failure condition. If the numbers of expected bubbles is not correct, then future checks are likely to not be able to run on the data so returning early ensures the student gets meaningful feedback.\nimport sketchresponse\nfrom grader_lib import GradeableFunction, LineSegment, PolyLine, Polygon\n\nproblemconfig = sketchresponse.config({\n    &#39;width&#39;: 750,\n    &#39;height&#39;: 420,\n    &#39;xrange&#39;: [-4, 4],\n    &#39;yrange&#39;: [-2.5, 2.5],\n    &#39;xscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;yscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;plugins&#39;: [\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;axes&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;polyline&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;pl&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Beam&#39;, &#39;closed&#39;: False, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;lightblue&#39;, &#39;readonly&#39;: True},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;polyline&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;pg&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Isolation bubble&#39;, &#39;closed&#39;: True, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;gray&#39;, &#39;fillColor&#39;: &#39;lightblue&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;point&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;pt&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Point&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;red&#39;, &#39;size&#39;: 5, &#39;hollow&#39;: False, &#39;readonly&#39;: True, &#39;tag&#39;: {&#39;value&#39;: &#39;tag&#39;, &#39;xoffset&#39;: 5, &#39;yoffset&#39;: -5, &#39;align&#39;: &#39;start&#39;}},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;line-segment&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;ls&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Force&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;green&#39;, &#39;dashStyle&#39;: &#39;solid&#39;, &#39;lengthContraint&#39;: 50, &#39;arrowHead&#39;: {&#39;length&#39;: 10, &#39;base&#39;: 7}, &#39;readonly&#39;: True},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;line-segment&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;c&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Segment&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;black&#39;, &#39;dashStyle&#39;: &#39;dashdotted&#39;, &#39;lengthContraint&#39;: 20, &#39;readonly&#39;: True, &#39;tag&#39;: {&#39;value&#39;: &#39;tag&#39;, &#39;xoffset&#39;: 5, &#39;yoffset&#39;: 5, &#39;align&#39;: &#39;start&#39;, &#39;position&#39;: &#39;middle&#39;}},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;stamp&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;cwm&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;CWM&#39;, &#39;scale&#39;: 0.5, &#39;src&#39;: &#39;/static/examples/cw_moment.png&#39;, &#39;readonly&#39;: True},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;stamp&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;ccwm&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;CCWM&#39;, &#39;scale&#39;: 0.5, &#39;src&#39;: &#39;/static/examples/ccw_moment.png&#39;, &#39;readonly&#39;: True}\n    ],\n    &#39;initialstate&#39;: {\n  &quot;pl&quot;: [\n    [\n      {\n        &quot;y&quot;: 41,\n        &quot;x&quot;: 93\n      },\n      {\n        &quot;y&quot;: 293,\n        &quot;x&quot;: 94\n      },\n      {\n        &quot;y&quot;: 293,\n        &quot;x&quot;: 563\n      }\n    ],\n    []\n  ],\n  &quot;pt&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 41,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 93,\n      &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;A&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 293,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 563,\n      &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;B&quot;\n    }\n  ],\n  &quot;ls&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 344,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 468\n    },\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 296,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 468\n    }\n  ],\n  &quot;c&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 256,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 187,\n      &quot;tag&quot;: &quot;C&quot;\n    },\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 345,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 187\n    }\n  ],\n  &quot;cwm&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 126,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 93\n    }\n  ],\n  &quot;ccwm&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;y&quot;: 293,\n      &quot;x&quot;: 280\n    }\n  ]\n}\n})\n\n@sketchresponse.grader\ndef grader(pl, pg, pt, ls, c, cwm, ccwm):\n\n    pl = PolyLine.PolyLines(pl)\n    pg = Polygon.Polygons(pg)\n    cls = LineSegment.LineSegments(c)\n\n    beam = pl.get_polyline_as_segments(0)\n\n    if not pg.get_polygon_count() == 1:\n        return False, &quot;Did you forget the isolation bubble?&quot;\n\n    poly = pg.polygons[0]\n\n    beam1 = beam.segments[0]\n    beam2 = beam.segments[1]\n\n    if len(pg.get_intersections_with_polygon_boundary(beam1, poly)) &gt; 0:\n        return False, &quot;Isolation bubble should not cut vertical beam.&quot;\n\n    if not len(pg.get_intersections_with_polygon_boundary(beam2, poly)) == 1:\n        return False, &quot;Isolation bubble should only cut the horizontal beam once.&quot;\n\n    if pg.point_is_on_boundary([-2, -1]) == None:\n        return False, &quot;Check where the isolation bubble cuts the horizontal beam.&quot;\n\n    if pg.point_is_on_boundary([-3, 2]) == None and pg.point_is_on_boundary([2, -1]) == None:\n        return False, &quot;Check the isolation bubble containment.&quot;\n\n    return True, &quot;Good job!&quot;\n\nTesting the script\nOnce the script is written, you can run the script in the local testing server.

This allows you to get immediate feedback on how well your grading script works without having to upload anything to your server.\nFlask\nThe local testing server is implemented using Flask. If you do not have flask you will need to install it, which is easily done by running the command. If you are in Windows make sure you are running the Git Bash shell as Administrator.\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nRunning the server\nBuilding the sketch tool distribution\nBefore you can run the local server, you need to build a local copy of the sketch tool. If you\nhave already done this and you have not modified the sketch tool in the interim you can skip\nthis step. Otherwise, follow the instructions here for details on building the sketch tool distribution.\nStart the grader local server\nTo run the local server, make sure the grading script you are testing is in the grading_scripts directory. Then run the following command from the repository root directory. If you are in Windows you may need to run the Git Bash shell as Administrator to interact with the local server.\n$ python server.py\n\nYou should see a message telling you that the server is running on http://localhost:5000.\nTesting your script\nOpen your web browser of choice and put the following in the url bar, where  is the filename of your grader script (leaving the .py extension off):\n$ http://localhost:5000/&lt;grader script name&gt;\n\nYou will now see a locally running copy of the SketchResponse Sketch Tool using the configuration options you defined in your grading script.

The steps are not required every time you upload your course, though; python_lib.zip won&#39;t be deleted by course uploads.\nCreating SketchResponse problems\n\nCreate a new Advanced Problem in Studio (or a  if authoring in XML).\nUse the following problem template, replacing the appropriate sections with your own content:\n\n    &lt;problem&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Replace this text with your own problem description.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;script type=&quot;loncapa/python&quot;&gt;&lt;![CDATA[\n\n    # Include your grading script here (beginning with import sketchresponse)\n\n    ]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n    &lt;customresponse cfn=&quot;grader&quot; expect=&quot;See solution.&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;jsinput width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;550&quot; gradefn=&quot;getGrade&quot; get_statefn=&quot;getState&quot; set_statefn=&quot;setState&quot; html_file=&quot;https://sketch-response.surge.sh/sketch-tool/v1/index.html#$problemconfig&quot; sop=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/customresponse&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;solution&gt;\n\n    &lt;p&gt;Provide the solution to your problem here.

May be &#39;start&#39;|&#39;middle&#39;|&#39;end&#39;.\n\n\n&#39;readonly&#39;: &lt;True|False&gt; - if True marks the plugin as readonly and not available in the toolbar and any data in the initialstate from this plugin is drawn to the canvas in a non-editable form.\n\nE.g.\n{&#39;name&#39;: &#39;stamp&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;st&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Stamp&#39;, &#39;src&#39;: &#39;/static/image.png&#39;, &#39;tag&#39;: {&#39;value&#39;: &#39;tag&#39;, &#39;xoffset&#39;: 15, &#39;yoffset&#39;: 15, &#39;align&#39;: &#39;start&#39;}}\n\n\nPolyLine/Polygon\nThe PolyLine plugin adds a button to the tool to draw a PolyLine or Polygon by\nplacing the points that define its component line segments. It has seven\nparameters that must be defined:\n\n&#39;name&#39;: &#39;polyline&#39; - the name key must have the value\n&#39;polyline&#39;\n&#39;id&#39;: &lt;unique identifier string&gt; - the id key must have a unique value.\nThis value is used as the key for the data created by this plugin in the JSON\nstring returned to the grader function.\n&#39;label&#39;: &lt;descriptive string&gt; - the label key should be given a descriptive string. This string will be used to label the selection button in the javascript\nfront-end tool.\n&#39;closed&#39;: &lt;True|False&gt; - True if you want a polygon, False if you want a polyline.\n&#39;color&#39;: &lt;a color string&gt; - the color key should be give a color string that\njavascript recognizes. A listing of color names can be found here.\n&#39;fillColor&#39;: &lt;a color string&gt; - the fillColor is used if the &#39;closed&#39; parameter is set to True.\n&#39;dashStyle&#39;: &lt;line dash string&gt;(default: &#39;solid&#39;) - the dashStyle key should have a string\ndescription of the dash style to used for drawing the line. Possible values: &#39;dashed&#39;, &#39;longdashed&#39;, &#39;dotted&#39;, &#39;dashdotted&#39;, &#39;solid&#39;.\n\nIt also has optional parameters:\n\n&#39;tag&#39;: &lt;object&gt; - the tag key must be an object containing the following keys:\n&#39;value&#39;: &lt;string&gt; - the intial value of the tag when the data is drawn on the canvas.\n&#39;xoffset&#39;: &lt;int&gt; - the pixel offset in the x direction.\n&#39;yoffset&#39;: &lt;int&gt; - the pixel offset in the y direction.\n&#39;align&#39;: &lt;string&gt; - a string defining the position of the tag from which the offsets are applied. May be &#39;start&#39;|&#39;middle&#39;|&#39;end&#39;.\n\n\n&#39;readonly&#39;: &lt;True|False&gt; - if True marks the plugin as readonly and not available in the toolbar and any data in the initialstate from this plugin is drawn to the canvas in a non-editable form.\n\nE.g.\n{&#39;name&#39;: &#39;polyline&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;pl&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;PolyLine&#39;, &#39;closed&#39;: True, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;gray&#39;, &#39;fillColor&#39;: &#39;lightblue&#39;, &#39;dashStyle&#39;: &#39;dashdotted&#39;, &#39;tag&#39;: {&#39;value&#39;: &#39;tag&#39;, &#39;xoffset&#39;: 15, &#39;yoffset&#39;: 15, &#39;align&#39;: &#39;start&#39;}}\n\n\nInitial State\nWhile not strictly a plugin, the initial state configuration parameter can be used to set data to predrawn to a canvas using declared plugins. In the problem configuration, it is declared at the same level as the &#39;plugins&#39; tag.\nThe initial state data can be automatically generated using the local testing server, copying and pasting the output into the grader script after manually drawing the initial state data using the sketch tool. If you do not want initial state data to be editable after the fact, you can mark the plugins used to generate the intial state data as &#39;readonly&#39; and they will not be accessible in the toolbar and the data drawn on the canvas will not be editable.\nE.g.\nThe initial state configuration below uses a point plugin with id &#39;pt&#39; to initialize two points at the given pixel positions on the canvas.\n&#39;initialstate&#39;: {\n  &quot;pt&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;x&quot;: 93,\n      &quot;y&quot;: 41\n    },\n    {\n      &quot;x&quot;: 563,\n      &quot;y&quot;: 293\n    }\n  ]\n\n"},"api/":{"url":"api/","title":"Grader Library API Reference","body":"Grading Library Application Programming Interface (API)\nThe SketchResponse API was designed to name grading functions as clearly as possible. We recognize that our primary users are not necessarily going to be professional programmers and so detailed, readable, explicit library function names are prioritized.\nAs you explore the API, you will find that almost all of the functionality provided allows for the user to customize thresholds to determine correctness of given input. There are default thresholds provided for all of the functionality of this api, which has been determined through experimentation and actual usage data from students in MIT and edX courses.\nThere are three modules that you may interact with in the Grader Library API. The majority of the grading functions are accessed through the GradeableFunction module. Functionality to do with evaluating asymptotes is found in the Asymptote module. A handful of grading functions either take Point objects as arguments, or return them as results so a brief description of it is included here as well.\nThe Grader Library API is also hosted separately with a searchable index here. Direct links to the individual modules are below.\n\nAsymptote\nLineSegment\nPolyLine\nPolygon\nGradeableFunction\nPoint\n\n"},"offline_docs.html":{"url":"offline_docs.html","title":"Offline Documentation","body":"Offline SketchResponse Documents\nFor convenience, PDF copies of both this documentation and the API documentation can be\nfound at the links below.\n\nSketchResponse.pdf\nSketchResponseAPI.pdf\n\n"},"GLOSSARY.html":{"url":"GLOSSARY.html","body":""}}}
