is a Javascript/Python(2.5-2.7) tool for drawing and evaluating\nmathematical functions. It was designed for use with the edX online\ncourseware platform. However, it is a self-contained application that can be\nintegrated into other web platforms.\nDemo\nBefore we get into the technical details, try out a SketchResponse Demo to get a sense of what SketchResponse can do.\nMotivation\nTODO Martin said he would write a paragraph.\nFeatures\n\nSketch Tool - configurable Javascript front-end with plugin components to provide different\nfunction drawing and annotation capabilities. See\nSketch-Tool Plugin Configuration for a description of the available\nplugins.\nGrader Library - python back-end that provides an API of function grading methods that\ncan be composed to construct custom grading scripts. See\nCreate a Simple Grading Script for a tutorial on building\na simple grading script.\n\nRead More\n\nSketch Tool\nPreliminary results using SketchResponse on edX\n\n"},"getting_started.html":{"url":"getting_started.html","title":"Getting Started","body":"Getting started from zero\nPrerequisites\nTo work with the SketchResponse codebase, there are a few technology prerequisites that you will need installed on your machine.\n\nIn order to clone the repository you will need to install Git on your computer. You may also want to create a Github account, though you should not need one to simply clone the SketchResponse repository from the command line. You will need to be logged into a Github account if you want to clone the repository through your browser. You will also need a Github account if you want to contribute changes back to the project.\n\nThe Sketch Tool front-end is built using Node.js and npm (which is now packaged with Node). You will need to have both of these installed on your computer.\n\nThe Grader Library back-end is built using Python and relies on a couple python packages that you will need to install. We recommend you use the pip python package installer. If you are using an up-to-date python installation you probably already have it installed. If you already have another python package manager, we only use commonly available packages so it should not be a problem.\n\nYou will also need to be comfortable using the command-line to execute commands. If you are using Windows, you should use the Git Bash Shell to execute all commands in this document.\n\n\nIf you have statisfied all of the above prerequisites, then we can start working on the codebase.\nGetting the codebase\n\nClone this repository to the directory of your choice:\n\nBy using HTTPS:\n$ git clone https://github.com/SketchResponse/sketchresponse.git\n\n\nBy using SSH:\n$ git clone git@github.com:SketchResponse/sketchresponse.git\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning either of the above commands will create a new directory called SketchResponse. This SketchResponse directory is your copy of the repository. The rest of this document will refer to it as the repo directory.\n\nRun this command to change directories to the repo of the SketchResponse repository.\n$ cd SketchResponse\n\n\n\nBuilding the Sketch Tool front-end\n\nChange to the sketch_tool directory:\n$ cd sketch_tool\n\n\nInstall dependencies listed in package.json using npm:\n$ npm install\n\nJSPM will pull in additional dependencies automatically on a post-install script.\n\nBuild a distribution of the Sketch Tool. The distribution directory will be found in the /static/sketch_tool_dist/ directory.\n$ npm run build\n\n\n\nNow you have a built distribution of the Sketch Tool front-end, we will use it later to let us test grading scripts. The front-end distribution is also what you will need to have hosted on a public server when deploying SketchResponse for your application.\nGrader Library back-end dependencies\nThe SketchResponse grader library back-end has only two third party package requirements, which are listed in the requirements.txt file.\n\nflask\nnumpy\n\nYou will need to be in the repo directory of the codebase. If you are still in the sketch_tool directory, run the following command to change back to the repo directory.\n$ cd ..\n\nNow that you are in the repo directory, you can run the following command to install the required python packages.\n$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n\nNumpy is used to support the mathematical computations of the grader library.\nFlask is required to run a local server for convenience when implementing and testing new grading scripts. This lets you test your scripts without having to deploy them to another server, giving you more immediate feedback and simplifying the debugging process. See the Tutorial Test a Grading Script on a Local Server for details.\nWhat&#39;s next\nNow that you have the codebase installed and ready to use, lets start looking at how to configure the Sketch Tool and implement a couple grading scripts. Click here.\n"},"using_sr.html":{"url":"using_sr.html","title":"Using SketchResponse","body":"Using SketchResponse\nUsing SketchResponse means writing python scripts to provide a configuration for the Sketch Tool front-end and an implementation of the grader method using the Grader Library back-end API. We call these grading scripts.\nWhat is a grading script\nBefore we get started writing scripts, we want to familiarize ourselves with the structure of a grading script. Read a description of the grading script template here\nWriting our first grading script\nNow that we know the pieces that must be implemented in the grading script, lets get started by implementing an extremely simple script. All this script will do is using the Grader Library to evalutate whether or not drawn function represents a straight line, or line segment. Click here to follow this tutorial.\nWriting a more complicated script\nOkay that was pretty easy, lets try building something a little more realistic. This grader script will be for a relatively simple polynomial function. Click here to follow this tutorial.\nTesting your grading scripts\nAs you probably saw at the end of each of our grading script examples, there was a brief description of testing that example script using a local server. More details on how to run that process can be found here.\nWhere to go from here\nAs you might expect, there are a lot of different types of function sketches that can be grading using this tool, however the current grading library is focused on introductory calculus type problems. We are working to expand the scope of the functions that can be sketched and graded, but it is a work in progress.\nWe have only demonstrated the use of a handful of the grading functions provided by the Grader Library Application Programming Interface(API). Explore the API to see what other grading options are available.\n"},"template.html":{"url":"template.html","title":"A grading script template","body":"Grading script template\nA grader script template can be see below. There are two components of the grader script:\n\nSketch Tool configuration\ngrader method implementation\n\nThe details of each of these components are examined in greater detail in the simple and complex(complex_grader.md) grading script examples.

All this grader will do is test whether the input function\nis of a straight line.\nEach grader script at its base is composed of two components\n 1. The problem configuration\n 2. The grader function\nImports\nThere are two SketchResponse python modules that must be imported for this simple example. All grader scripts must import the sketchresponse module. There are two other modules that provide different grading helper functions. In this case, we only need to input the GradeableFunction module from grader_lib.\nimport sketchresponse\nfrom grader_lib import GradeableFunction\n\nProblem configuration\nThe problem configuration is passed to the javascript front end to define the\nsize and scale of the drawing space and to define which drawing tools are\navailable for the problem. The sketchresponse.config() function takes a dict of\nconfiguration options.\nIn the example configuration below, the first six key/value pairs are required:\n\n&#39;width&#39;: 750 sets the pixel width of the drawing space as 750 pixels\n&#39;height&#39;: 420 sets the pixel height of the drawing space to 420 pixels\n&#39;xrange&#39;: [-2.35, 2.35] sets the numerical range of the x axis\n&#39;yrange&#39;: [-1.15, 1.15] sets the numerical range of the y axis\n&#39;xscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39; sets the scale of the x axis to linear (only option currently implemented)\n&#39;yscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39; sets the scale of the y axis to linear (only option currently implemented)\n\nThe last entry &#39;plugins&#39; takes a list of dicts that enable the specific javascript plugins that are available to the user. All plugins are declared by &#39;name&#39;.\nThe &#39;axes&#39; plugin entry is the simplest plugin to enable. It has no configuration options so all that must be set is the &#39;name&#39;. This plugin enables the axes in the drawing space. It should probably be on by default no?\nThe &#39;freeform&#39; plugin entry enables the freeform drawing tool. It has three configuration options to set:\n\n&#39;id&#39; sets the name of the argument of the grader callback function (described in the next section) to which the data generated by this plugin is passed.\n&#39;label&#39; is the name of the tool displayed to the user.\n&#39;color&#39; is the color used to render the drawn function.\n\nA listing of all the built-in plugins can be found at SketchResponse Plugins.\nproblemconfig = sketchresponse.config({\n    &#39;width&#39;: 750,\n    &#39;height&#39;: 420,\n    &#39;xrange&#39;: [-2.35, 2.35],\n    &#39;yrange&#39;: [-1.15, 1.15],\n    &#39;xscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;yscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;plugins&#39;: [\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;axes&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;freeform&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;f&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Function f(x)&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;blue&#39;},\n    ]\n})\n\nThe above problem configuration settings will create a javascript tool that looks something like the image below.\n\nDefine the grader callback function\n\n\n@sketchresponse.grader\ndef grader(f):\n    gf = GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction(f)\n\n    if not gf.is_straight():\n        return False, &#39;Not straight&#39;\n\n    return True, &#39;Good Job&#39;\n\nThe grader callback function implements the function passed to the sketchinput\ngrader to evaluate the data sent from the javascript tool.\nThe arguments of the grader function are the &#39;id&#39; values as defined in the\nproblem configuration above. E.g. in our problem configuration we enabled the\nfreeform drawing tool with id &#39;f&#39; and we have a corresponding argument f in\nthe signature of the function that will be automatically unpacked.\nBefore we can execute any grading helper functions on the data, we must\ninstantiate the data as a GradeableFunction.\nIn this simple example all we are checking is that the submitted function\ndefines a straight line over its entire domain. We are not checking for slope\nof the line. To do this we call the grader helper function gf.is_straight().\nis_straight() returns a boolean value. The full API documentation for the\ngrader helper functions can be found at SketchResponse API.\nAnd that&#39;s it! Those two simple blocks of code complete our first grader script.\nAdmittedly this particular script doesn&#39;t do much. Check out the Complex Grader example for a more realistic grader tutorial on an\nexample math problem.\nTesting the script\nOnce the script is written, you can run the script in the local testing server. See the Test a Grading Script on a Local Server tutorial for details on installing and running the testing server.\nThere is already a copy of this grader script in the grader_scripts directory so all you need to do is start the server and point your browser of choice at the url:\nhttp://localhost:5000/simple_grader\nYou should see the configured Sketch Tool. If you draw a straight(ish) line and press the check button you will get accept message. If the line is not straight enough, you will get a reject message.\n"},"complex_grader.html":{"url":"complex_grader.html","title":"A complex grading script","body":"A more realistic grader script\nThis document will walk through the implementation of a grader script for\na more complicated problem than the Simple Grader Tutorial tutorial. The\nproblem description for this grader script is below.\nSketch the function f(x) = 2x2 / x2 - 1. \nLabel vertical and horizontal asymptotes, extrema, and inflection points.\n\nThis problem will introduce new javascript drawing plugins to handle labeling\nasymptotes and points and some new backend API functions that can be used to\nevaluate these new sources of data.\nImports\nThere are three SketchResponse python modules that must be imported for this simple example. As you saw in the Simple Grader Tutorial all grader scripts must import the sketchresponse module. We again need to input the GradeableFunction module from grader_lib, but also need to import the Asymptote module\nto support the asymptote labeling task.\nimport sketchresponse\nfrom grader_lib import GradeableFunction, Asymptote\n\nProblem configuration\nThe problem configuration is passed to the javascript front end to define the\nsize and scale of the drawing space and to define which drawing tools are\navailable for the problem. The sketchresponse.config() function takes a dict of\nconfiguration options.\nIn the example configuration below, the first six key/value pairs are required. In this configuration we increase the ranges of the X and Y axes compared to the Simple Grader Tutorial:\n\n&#39;width&#39;: 750 sets the pixel width of the drawing space as 750 pixels\n&#39;height&#39;: 420 sets the pixel height of the drawing space to 420 pixels\n&#39;xrange&#39;: [-3.5, 3.5] sets the numerical range of the x axis\n&#39;yrange&#39;: [-4.5, 4.5] sets the numerical range of the y axis\n&#39;xscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39; sets the scale of the x axis to linear (only option currently implemented)\n&#39;yscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39; sets the scale of the y axis to linear (only option currently implemented)\n\nThe last entry &#39;plugins&#39; takes a list of dicts that enable the specific javascript plugins that are available to the user. All plugins are declared by &#39;name&#39;.\nThe &#39;axes&#39; and &#39;freeform&#39; plugin usage here is identical to the Simple Grader Tutorial and is explained there as well as on the [Plugin Description Page(probconfig_plugins.md).\nThere are three new plugins introduced in this grading script: &#39;vertical-line&#39;, &#39;horizontal-line&#39;, and &#39;point&#39;. The declaration of these plugins is very similar to the declaration of the &#39;freeform&#39; plugin, however, each type of plugin has one additional parameter that needs to be defined: &#39;dashStyle&#39; for the lines, and &#39;size&#39; for the points.\nThe &#39;vertical-line&#39; plugin entry enables the a labeling tool for vertical asymptotes. It has four configuration options to set:\n\n&#39;id&#39; sets the name of the argument of the grader callback function (described in the next section) to which the data generated by this plugin is passed.\n&#39;label&#39; is the name of the tool displayed to the user.\n&#39;color&#39; is the color used to render the drawn function.\n&#39;dashStyle&#39; is the style of dashed line to used to draw the asymptote.\n\nThe &#39;horizontal-line&#39; plugin entry enables a labeling tool for horizontal asymptotes. Its configuration options mirror the &#39;vertical-line&#39;.\nIn this problem, we want students to label both extrema points and the inflection point for the function. To do this we can declare two instances of the &#39;point&#39; plugin with different &#39;id&#39; and &#39;label&#39; values. The &#39;point&#39; plugin has four configuration options to set:\n\n&#39;id&#39; sets the name of the argument of the grader callback function (described in the next section) to which the data generated by this plugin is passed.\n&#39;label&#39; is the name of the tool displayed to the user.\n&#39;color&#39; is the color used to render the drawn function.\n&#39;size&#39; is the pixel width of the point drawn by the plugin.\n\nA listing of all the built-in plugins can be found at SketchResponse Plugins.\nproblemconfig = sketchresponse.config({\n    &#39;width&#39;: 750,\n    &#39;height&#39;: 420,\n    &#39;xrange&#39;: [-3.5, 3.5],\n    &#39;yrange&#39;: [-4.5, 4.5],\n    &#39;xscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;yscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;plugins&#39;: [\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;axes&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;freeform&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;f&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Function f(x)&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;blue&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;vertical-line&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;va&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Vertical asymptote&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;gray&#39;, &#39;dashStyle&#39;: &#39;dashdotted&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;horizontal-line&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;ha&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Horizontal asymptote&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;gray&#39;, &#39;dashStyle&#39;: &#39;dashdotted&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;point&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;cp&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Extremum&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;black&#39;, &#39;size&#39;: 15},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;point&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;ip&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Inflection point&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;orange&#39;,&#39;size&#39;: 15}\n    ]\n})\n\nThe above problem configuration settings will create a javascript tool that looks something like the image below.\n\nDefine the grader callback function\n\n\nHandling the input data\n@sketchresponse.grader\ndef grader(f,cp,ip,va,ha):\n\n    f = GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction(f)\n    cp = GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction(cp)\n    va = Asymptote.VerticalAsymptotes(va)\n    ha = Asymptote.HorizontalAsymptotes(ha)\n    ip = GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction(ip)\n\n    msg=&#39;&#39;\n\nThe first thing that the grader function needs to do is format the input data so that Grader Library API methods of interest can be used to check specific features of the input data.\nAs explained in the Simple Grader Tutorial the data is passed to the grader function as a dictionary with keys equal to the &#39;id&#39; values used in the pluginconfig above so the dictionary can be directly unpacked into argument variables with the same names.\nThe &#39;freeform&#39; and &#39;point&#39; data are evaluated with API methods in the GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction class. The &#39;vertical-line&#39; and &#39;horizontal-line&#39; data are evaluted with API methods in the Asymptote.VerticalAsymptote and &#39;Asymptote.HorizontalAsymptote` classes respectively.\nThe msg variable will be used when evaluating specific checks on the data to supply check specific feedback to the student if errors are found.\nChecking the number of extrema points labeled\nif cp.get_number_of_points() != 1:\n   if cp.get_number_of_points() == 3:\n      msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Are you sure about the number of extrema? (note that you should not label the endpoints of your function)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n   else:\n    msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Are you sure about the number of extrema?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nThis first check verifies that there is only one extremum point labeled in the input data. It also checks for a common error case where students label the end points of their function to provide more helpful feedback.\nChecking the number of inflection points\nif ip.get_number_of_points() != 0:\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Are you sure about the number of extrema?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nThis particular function does not have any inflection points so this check verifies that the student did not put any unnecessary labels.\nChecking the number of asymptotes\nif va.get_number_of_asyms() != 2:\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Are you sure about the number of vertical asymptotes?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\n\nif ha.get_number_of_asyms() != 1:\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Are you sure about the number of horizontal asymptotes?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nThis function should have 2 vertical asymptote labels and 1 horizontal asymptote label. If either of theses checks fail, appropriate feedback messages are provided.\nChecking the position of the extremum point\nif not cp.has_point_at(x=0):\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Check the x value of your critical point&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nThe extremum point label for the function should be at position x=0.\nChecking the positions of the asymptotes\nif not va.has_asym_at_value(-1) or not va.has_asym_at_value(1):\n   v1 = va.closest_asym_to_value(-1)\n   v2 = va.closest_asym_to_value(1)\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Check the locations of your vertical asymptotes.  &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nif not ha.has_asym_at_value(2):\n   ha1 = ha.closest_asym_to_value(2)\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Check the locations of your horizontal asymptotes. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nThe vertical asymptotes should be at positions x=-1 and x=1. The horizonal asymptote should be at the position y=2. As you can see, you can also get references to the actual asymptote values if you wanted to use them for further checks, or to customize your feedback messages.\nChecking that the extremum point is on the freeform line\nmaxpt = cp.get_point_at(x=0)\n\nif not f.has_value_y_at_x(maxpt.y, maxpt.x):\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Make sure your critical points lie on your function!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nHere we get a reference to the extremum point and use that point&#39;s x and y coordinates to make sure that it is sitting on the freeform line of the function. The grader method does use a configurable threshold value to ensure pixel perfect placement is not necessary to pass this kind of check.\nChecking the increasing and decreasing ranges of the freeform line\nincreasing_ok = f.is_increasing_between(-4, -1) and f.is_increasing_between(-1, 0)\ndecreasing_ok = f.is_decreasing_between(0, 1) and f.is_decreasing_between(1, 4)\nif not (increasing_ok and decreasing_ok):\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Where should the graph be increasing and decreasing?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nThe freeform line drawn by the student should be increasing over the ranges (-4,-1) and (-1,0). It should also be decreasing over the ranges (0,1) and (1,4). Again these grading methods have configurable thresholds to ensure they don&#39;t unfairly fail student input.\nChecking the value of the freeform line over specific ranges\nif not f.is_greater_than_y_between(2,-4,-1):\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Your function seems to be in the wrong region on the interval (-4,-1)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nif not f.is_greater_than_y_between(2,1,4):\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Your function seems to be in the wrong region on the interval (1,4)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nif not f.is_less_than_y_between(0,-1,1):\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Your function seems to be in the wrong region on the interval (-1,1)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nHere we are performing three sanity checks on the values of the freeform line over specific ranges. First, we check that f(x) &gt;= 2 over the range (-4,-1). Second, we check that f(x) &gt;= 2 over the range (1,4). Lastly, we check that f(x) &lt;= 0 over the range (-1,1).\nChecking the curvature of the freeform line\ncurvature_up_ok = f.has_positive_curvature_between(-4, -1) and f.has_positive_curvature_between(1, 4)\ncurvature_down_ok= f.has_negative_curvature_between(-1,1)\n\nif not (curvature_up_ok and curvature_down_ok):\n   msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Where is the function convave up and concave down?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;\n\nThe final checks we will perform make sure that the freeform line has the expected curvature over specific ranges. The curvature should be positive over the ranges (-4,-1) and (1,4). The curvature should be negative over the range (-1,1).\nPutting it all together\nCombining all the code above into a single function gives us the following. You will notice that the error message variable msg is tested at multiple points during the evaluation and used as an early failure condition. If the numbers of expected labels are not correct, then future checks are likely to not be able to run on the data so returning early ensures the student gets good feedback.\nimport sketchresponse\nfrom grader_lib import GradeableFunction, Asymptote\n\nproblemconfig = sketchresponse.config({\n    &#39;width&#39;: 750,\n    &#39;height&#39;: 420,\n    &#39;xrange&#39;: [-3.5, 3.5],\n    &#39;yrange&#39;: [-4.5, 4.5],\n    &#39;xscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;yscale&#39;: &#39;linear&#39;,\n    &#39;plugins&#39;: [\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;axes&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;freeform&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;f&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Function f(x)&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;blue&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;vertical-line&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;va&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Vertical asymptote&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;gray&#39;, &#39;dashStyle&#39;: &#39;dashdotted&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;horizontal-line&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;ha&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Horizontal asymptote&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;gray&#39;, &#39;dashStyle&#39;: &#39;dashdotted&#39;},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;point&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;cp&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Extremum&#39;, &#39;color&#39;: &#39;black&#39;, &#39;size&#39;: 15},\n        {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;point&#39;, &#39;id&#39;: &#39;ip&#39;, &#39;label&#39;: &#39;Inflection point&#39;, &#39;color&#39;:&#39;orange&#39;,&#39;size&#39;: 15}\n    ]\n})\n\n@sketchresponse.grader\ndef grader(f,cp,ip,va,ha):\n\n    f = GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction(f)\n    cp = GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction(cp)\n    va = Asymptote.VerticalAsymptotes(va)\n    ha = Asymptote.HorizontalAsymptotes(ha)\n    ip = GradeableFunction.GradeableFunction(ip)\n\n    msg=&#39;&#39;\n\n    if cp.get_number_of_points() != 1:\n        if cp.get_number_of_points() == 3:\n            msg += &#39;&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;Are you sure about the number of extrema?

You may want to include an image of a correct solution as well as text.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/solution&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/problem&gt;\n\nNotes\nUnlike most other input types, you cannot combine SketchResponse problems with other input types (or other SketchResponse inputs) in a single  tag; doing so will lead to students losing attempts and other unexpected behavior.\n"},"probconfig_plugins.html":{"url":"probconfig_plugins.html","title":"Sketch Tool Configuration Reference","body":"Problem Configuration Plugins\nThis document provides a description of all the SketchResponse plugins and how\nto declare them. Declaring any plugin in a grader&#39;s problem configuration\nenables the selection of that plugin in the javascript front-end tool.\nAny of these plugins can be declared multiple times causing\nmultiple instances of the plugin to be enabled in the javascript tool. See\nthe Complex Grader Example for an example where this\nis used.\nTable of Contents\n\nAxes\nBackground\nFreeform\nPoint\nVertical Asymptote\nHorizontal Asymptote\nImage\n\n\nAxes\nAdds horizontal and vertical axes with major and minor ticks and their associated gridlines.\n\n&#39;name&#39;: &#39;axes&#39; - the name key must have the value &#39;axes&#39;\n&#39;xmajor&#39;: &lt;number&gt;(default: 1) - the major tick spacing for the x axis\n&#39;ymajor&#39;: &lt;number&gt;(default: 1) - the major tick spacing for the y axis\n&#39;xminor&#39;: &lt;number&gt;(default: 0.25) - the minor tick spacing for the x axis\n&#39;yminor&#39;: &lt;number&gt;(default: 0.25) - the minor tick spacing for the y axis\n\nE.g.\n{&#39;name&#39;: &#39;axes&#39;}\n\n\nBackground\nSets the background image for the drawing canvas.

We recognize that our primary users are not necessarily going to be professional programmers and so detailed, readable, explicit library function names are prioritized.\nAs you explore the API, you will find that almost all of the functionality provided allows for the user to customize thresholds to determine correctness of given input. There are default thresholds provided for all of the functionality of this api, which has been determined through experimentation and actual usage data from students in MIT and edX courses.\nThere are three modules that you may interact with in the Grader Library API. The majority of the grading functions are accessed through the GradeableFunction module. Functionality to do with evaluating asymptotes is found in the Asymptote module. A handful of grading functions either take Point objects as arguments, or return them as results so a brief description of it is included here as well.\nThe Grader Library API is also hosted separately with a searchable index here.
